Panda is a simple mod designed (initially) to speed up mass-disenchanting.
This functionality was expanded to include prospecting, gem cutting, and quick viewing of AuctioneerAdvanced prices for gems, dust and other materials.
Panda will also add price information to item tooltips where applicable.

Panda includes an auto-loot fix for prospecting and DE, since Blizzard has not fixed the longstanding issues with autoloot and crushing.
